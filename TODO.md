# Govee 5075 Monitor - TODO

 - Add support for audit logging. There is basic logging already, but not much in terms of full audit capability. I might add this sooner rather than later. 
 - Add support for more Govee devices
 - Break out the data handling from client/server to a module to enable faster addition of other "metrics" and "models"
