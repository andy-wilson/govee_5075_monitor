# Testing Strategy for Govee 5075 Monitor

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Govee 5075 Monitor, including test types, coverage goals, and implementation details.

## Test Types

### 1. Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on individual components and functions in isolation. They ensure that each component performs its intended function correctly.

**Key Components to Test:**
- Data decoding logic for Govee BLE packets
- Temperature and humidity calculations
- Data storage and retrieval
- API key authentication
- HTTP handlers
- Client-server communication

**Implementation Approach:**
- Use Go's built-in testing framework
- Create mocks for external dependencies
- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Test error handling and edge cases

### 2. Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that different components work together correctly. They focus on the interactions between components.

**Key Integration Points:**
- Client-server data transfer
- Authentication and authorization
- Data persistence and retrieval
- Time-based partitioning of data

**Implementation Approach:**
- Use in-memory HTTP servers for testing
- Set up test environments with temporary storage
- Test complete workflows from data collection to retrieval

### 3. BLE Mock Testing

Tests focused on Bluetooth functionality using mock implementations to avoid hardware dependencies.

**Key Testing Areas:**
- Device discovery
- Data packet parsing
- Multiple device handling
- Signal strength interpretation

**Implementation Approach:**
- Create mock BLE device implementations
- Simulate different device types and data patterns
- Test scanning and processing logic

### 4. Performance Testing

Verify that the system meets performance requirements under various conditions.

**Performance Aspects to Test:**
- Data handling under high load
- Concurrent client connections
- Storage efficiency with large datasets
- Response time for dashboard data

**Implementation Approach:**
- Benchmark tests for critical operations
- Stress tests with simulated high load
- Memory profiling

### 5. End-to-End Testing

Verify complete system functionality from data collection to visualization.

**Key E2E Test Scenarios:**
- Complete data flow from sensor to dashboard
- Authentication flows
- Data persistence across server restarts
- System behavior during network interruptions

**Implementation Approach:**
- Docker Compose for system setup
- Automated test scripts
- Simulated client behavior

## Continuous Integration Strategy

### GitHub Actions Workflow

Automated testing on every push and pull request to main branches:

1. **Setup Phase**
   - Set up Go environment
   - Install dependencies
   - Configure testing tools

2. **Test Execution Phase**
   - Run linters
   - Execute unit tests
   - Run integration tests
   - Perform mock-based BLE tests

3. **Analysis Phase**
   - Generate coverage reports
   - Check for performance regressions
   - Validate code quality

4. **Build Phase**
   - Build binaries for various platforms
   - Create Docker images
   - Publish artifacts

### Environment Matrix

Test across multiple configurations:
- Operating Systems: Ubuntu, macOS
- Go Versions: 1.18, 1.19, 1.20
- Architecture: amd64, arm64

## Testing Tools

1. **Go Testing Framework**
   - Built-in `testing` package
   - `testify` for assertions and mocks

2. **Coverage Analysis**
   - `go test -cover` for coverage metrics
   - Coverage visualization with `go tool cover`

3. **Performance Testing**
   - `go test -bench` for benchmarks
   - `pprof` for profiling

4. **Linting and Static Analysis**
   - `golangci-lint` for code quality
   - `go vet` for potential issues

5. **Automation**
   - Makefile for local test automation
   - GitHub Actions for CI/CD
   - Docker for consistent test environments

## Best Practices

1. **Test Independence**
   - Each test should be independent and isolated
   - Use temporary directories for file operations
   - Clean up resources after tests

2. **Mock External Dependencies**
   - Use mocks for Bluetooth, network, and time
   - Ensure deterministic test behavior

3. **Test Data Management**
   - Use versioned test fixtures
   - Generate test data programmatically when possible
   - Cover edge cases and boundary conditions

4. **Test Documentation**
   - Clearly document test purpose and covered scenarios
   - Use descriptive test names
   - Document any necessary setup or environment requirements

5. **Testing Edge Cases**
   - Network failures and timeouts
   - Invalid or malformed data
   - Resource exhaustion
   - Authentication edge cases
