# TODO - Govee 5075 Monitor

 - Add support for audit logging. There is basic logging already, but not much in terms of full audit capability. I might add this sooner rather than later. 
 - Add support for more Govee devices.
 - Break out the data handling from within client/server to separate modules, to enable faster addition of other "metrics" and device models.
