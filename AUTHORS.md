Project Authors
===============

The project was started after becoming increasingly frustrated with Govee's own software for reporting temperature and humidity readings. The iOS client is buggy as hell, and took ages to poll and display all sensors. The app is also becoming sales adware, so time to replace it with something useful for collating long term stats. 
I also wanted to have sensor data reliably available within Home Assistant, so decided to build something instead.
